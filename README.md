Senior Software Engineer at [Common Room](https://commonroom.io) where I am primarily focussed on front-end, but occasionally they let me write API code too.

For the previous 3.5 years I was a senior software engineer and technical lead at **[Dropbox](https://dropbox.com)** where I worked on the home, browse, and search experiences of [dropbox.com](https://dropbox.com/h).

Before that I worked at [Pebble](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pebble_(watch)) on the developer documentation website and the app store.
