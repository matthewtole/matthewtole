## Work

I am a software engineer and technical lead at **[Dropbox](https://dropbox.com)** where I work on the home, browse, and search experiences of [dropbox.com](https://dropbox.com/h).

## Personal

I am currently working on creating a **[video game](https://github.com/matthewtole/dungeon-manager)** that's a cross between Theme Hospital and Dungeon Keeper.

Check out **[my website](https://matthewtole.com)** to see what else I've built!
